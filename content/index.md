# About

I am a Chief Technology Officer with expertise in startup and scale up environments who loves building and leading effective teams.

I value the customer over the technology, data and scientific experimentation over intuitions, enjoy the learning over being too serious.

Currently, Iâ€™m a CTO at <a href="https://www.creditspring.co.uk">Creditspring</a> where we created the first ever subscription lending product in the UK. Previously I worked at <a href="https://www.zopa.com/">Zopa</a> leading the launch of their first ever UK car finance product.

When I am not working, I am probably going around with my Brompton bike. I solve hard problems with gelato.
