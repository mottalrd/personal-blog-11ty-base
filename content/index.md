# About

I am a Software Engineer with expertise in startup environments who loves building and leading effective teams.

I value the customer over the technology, data and scientific experimentation over intuitions, enjoy the learning over being too serious.

Currently, Iâ€™m a Chief Technology Officer at <a href="https://www.creditspring.co.uk">CreditSpring</a> where we are building an innovative interest-free lending product.

When I am not working, I am probably going around with my Brompton bike. I solve hard problems with gelato.
