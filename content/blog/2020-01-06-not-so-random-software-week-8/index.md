Welcome back to Not So Random Software. This week's links are dedicated to _Time_ and our relation to it. If you are anything like me you see time running faster and faster the more we get involved in our career; you need to build your strategy to not let the most precious asset in your life get discounted.

## A random article or paper

If prompted whether our life is the most important thing to us we would certainly reply _Yes._ However, we often trade our time with money, laziness, distractions, and entertainment. Not only that, by accumulating power and responsibilities we often build a trap for ourselves where we become slaves of our own making. The Stoics knew that very well and in this article, the book Shortness of Life by Seneca is covered in great detail.

## A random video or podcast

In this video, Avdi Grimm presents the fallacy of treating your life like a Software Transaction where the only possible outcomes are success or failure. Avdi brings a great insight suggesting that we model software in imitation of life, and vice-versa. This potentially makes developers some of the professional figures most affected by the blind pursuit of goals without careful consideration of the costs attached.

## A random book

ReWork by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson presents a different view on how to build a company where you stay focused on what matters and keep your operations as small as necessary. You'll learn how to save time and mental bandwidth over the process and build the company you would want to work for.

## A random tool

If you are a VIM user you might have been wondering how people are constantly reaching for the <ESC> key every time they switch between Insert mode and Normal mode. I found a solution to this problem with a combination of Karabiner-Elements to map the caps lock key to the control key and then using this Hammerspoon script to have it behave as <Ctrl> or <ESC> depending if I tap or hold.

## A random line of code

Did you know that you can grep over objects public methods in Ruby? Now you do!

```
irb(main):008:0> "hello".public_methods.grep /inc/
=> [:include?]
```

## A random quote

> Today as always, men fall into two groups: slaves and free men. Whoever does not have two-thirds of his day for himself, is a slave, whatever he may be: a statesman, a businessman, an official, or a scholar.
> 
> Friedrich Nietzsche
