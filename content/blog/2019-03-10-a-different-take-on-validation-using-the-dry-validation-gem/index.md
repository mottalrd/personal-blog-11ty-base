If you are using Rails and you find yourself fighting validations more often than you would like to, then you should consider watching my talk I gave at the London Ruby User Group this February about on dry-validation.

I will present the API surface which uses a schema based declarative approach and I will compare it with the classic ActiveModel::Validations approach in Rails for a simple but not trivial example.

You can find the talk here https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/13250-lrug
