Event sourcing is a design pattern to build applications that are domain centric and easy to extend. The pattern is based on the usage of a persistent event log which substitutes the more classical relational database model for Rails applications.

Last week I gave this presentation at the London Ruby User Group you can find the details of what I learned over the last year using such pattern, hope you enjoy it!
