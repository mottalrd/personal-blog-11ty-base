It's Christmas time, and we all get a bit lazy. Time to be with your friends and family rather than keeping up with your productivity hacks. I hope you can find a signal in the noise of these links.

## A random tool

With Data Science use cases exploding we need tools to make data analysis and experiments reproducible. Data Version Control helps you make your projects reproducible and shareable helping to answer questions about how a model was built. So we can all get lazy and let the machines do the work.

## A random line of code

Have you ever had to remove special characters from strings? Things I wish I didn't know, but I happen to do.

```
irb(main):009:0> your_very_exotic_name.tr("áéíóúÁÉÍÓÚäëïöüÄËÏÖÜ", "aeiouAEIOUaeiouAEIOU")
```

## A random video or podcast

We have all been there; you have a deadline sometimes far far away in the future and you are perfectly fine... until suddenly... it's tomorrow! How did that happen? Tim Urban gave a hilarious TED talk on this (unfortunately) very common story.

## A random article or paper

I have learned the hard way that I shouldn't plan any serious projects during Christmas time. Too many expectations and less time than you actually think. But then I thought...why not writing my own toy spell checker? Peter Norvig from Google has a very good article explaining a simple yet effective design. The solution has been translated in Ruby too!

## A random book

Part of the reasons why I have started blogging more frequently is that I want to practice my writing. On Writing Well by William Zinsser gave the mental framework to better understand the act of writing and approach it like a craft.

## A random quote

> Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
